            <p><em><strong>How I got blocked on a simple problem.</strong></em> I had to write some code that would take
                a list of numbers and remove all odd numbers. I was using this code that was prewritten by people behind
                mozilla and it all seemed to be working until I noticed that 0 doesn't show up. As 0 is also even this
                was an issue. And although I suspected where the issue might be I was reluctant to test that path first
                as I would second guess some simpler code first. Ofcourse once I persuaded my initial doubts I quickly
                came to realise that this pre written code that I'm using doesn't consider 0 a worthy number of leaving
                it in my list. This was solved by changing 1 word...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudocode, a lot of console, googling, trying a lot of things</li>
                <li>Irritated, second guessing myself</li>
                <li>Trust my gut a bit more, take a break and breathe</li>

            <p><em><strong>How I solved a problem in an elegant way.</strong></em> This happened when I entered the
                final phase of this weeks javascript challenges. Suddenly in the code examples in front of me there is a
                new way of defining a function and man oh man how this confused me. First thing I had in my mind was to
                just rewrite it in the usual way I'm used to see them but I managed to stand firm against this
                temptation and started researching how this way of writing them works. Resources were a bit hard to
                understand at first but once I felt like I understand how to write them I actually succeeded with first
                attempt. Afterwards I even nested these functions which made me feel extra cool.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Googling, again lots of console entries, trying different ways to access/pass values</li>
                <li>I was in the zone, although I didnt get to the result immediately I knew that I'm close and as this
                    was a new concept it really tickled my brains</li>
                <li>The power of console, I can't stress enough how much I use console when I'm writing JS</li>

                <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I have been using Pseudocode in some form before but now I made
                    aconscious attempt to be more specific with it and actually use it more often</li>
                <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> I guess that is what most of us do whenever we encounter an issue
                    and feel like we can guess it. I try random stuff quite often in conjunction with console.log</li>
                <li><strong>Rubber Ducky method:</strong> Haven't tried this one yet. Can't say I will but it's there
                    always on the back of my skull just in case.</li>
                <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> As so far most of the error messages have been
                    understandable, no misterious words or paths that doesn't make sense. So for now I read them I
                    understand them but I'm sure soon there will be more challenges here.</li>
                <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> Already mentioned it few times because it's the best thing. You
                    can type your code in console and as it is so easy to see what it returns once it is working as
                    intended you just copy/paste to editor. Or write in editor and paste in console and test it.</li>
                <li><strong>Googling:</strong> The most important one. I would guess. I feel like I'm getting better at
                    describing my problems with each day and pretty much that is what matters. How precise your
                    description of problems is, is what matters.</li>
                <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> Haven't done it yet as I see that as last resort. Might
                    try it just so someone gets a chance to try and explain</li>
                <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Would happen only if I would be superstuck</li>
                <li><strong>Improving my process of reflection:</strong> Need to work on it a bit more as quite often I
                    would quickly skim over my solutions and carry on</li>

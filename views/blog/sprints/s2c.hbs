                <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
                    <ul>
                        <li>My long term goal is to do contract work.</li>
                        <li>To achieve this I first need to put myself completely out there at EDA</li>
                        <li>I know that all the technical skills can be learned but that isn't really what cuts the edge
                            anymore</li>
                        <li>You actually have to be a decent human being and that is one of my big goals.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Confidence because just too often I have known the right path and answer but haven't spoken
                            up</li>
                        <li>Mindfulness about others. As sometimes my mouth might move a bit faster than my brain and
                            super rarely I would managed to talk my way into uncomfortable situations by being too
                            direct</li>
                        <li>Comunication and how to do it as quite often I would find it hard to speak about things that
                            fascinate me</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations

                        <li>I'll go with limitless</li>
                        <li>And things that might be considered my limitations are just stuff to work on to get better
                            at</li>
                        <li>I'm about getting stuff done, analyzing, drawing conclusions, questioning the process,
                            looking for ways to improve</li>
                        <li>I like to help!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
                    This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely
                    with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Joining EDA wasn't a 1-day or 1-month decision. It was well thought over, analyzed and other
                            paths considered.</li>
                        <li>I'm not here to try something out and hopefully get a developers job afterwards. I'm here to
                            finally put career on the right way and actually do something I enjoy</li>
                        <li>In preparation to EDA I have made sure that there wouldn't be any financial problems, my
                            partner is well aware of the upcoming workload and time has been prioritised accordingly.
                        </li>
                        <li>My productivity will be achieved by planning my time. As of now entering sprint-3 there is
                            still plenty of time to pick up habits that will help me to give my best and share my
                            knowledge while attending EDA</li>
                        <li>To ensure a safe environment I will make sure that my actions or words are considerate of
                            others while also looking around to make sure that nobody else is acting in unacceptable way
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I shall stick to problem solving methods first of all. Only once I have failed to resolve
                            this multiple times I shall reach out to my cohort first of all(If someone knows the answer
                            they make their neural pathways stronger and I get to move on - win win// think of cohort as
                            a big family).</li>
                        <li>Problems that cant be solved by my peers will be directed to programme coaches/tutors</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
                    <ul>
                        <li>I expect to receive answers to questions that have to be answered(some questions just have
                            to be asked and you see the answer)</li>
                        <li>I expect to receive guidance if asking for one</li>
                        <li>And going deeper into EDA world I feel like I expect more chats about their experience @ EDA
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I feel like there should be atleast 6hours at weekend when I turn myself of from thinking
                            about worldly matters. This should be time that would stay uninterrupted for my mental
                            wellbeing.</li>
                        <li>More to follow as too early to make a good judgement call on real time constraints</li>
                    </ul>

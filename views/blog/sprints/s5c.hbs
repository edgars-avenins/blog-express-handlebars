            <p><strong><em>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                        core learning?</em></strong><br> I should be careful when I think I know as I may jump to this
                conclusion too fast. I really enjoy teaching and helping with advice on how to tackle problems. I dont
                know how to take a break.</p>
            <p><strong><em>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
                        programming?</em></strong> I think when you're learning you can sort of show your values by the
                choices you make for example writing your own code vs using ready code and changing it. But when it
                comes to values while programming - you should ask if the thing you're working on is in line with what
                you believe in. If you're emmiting happyness all over the place would you work on some sort of scam code
                ?</p>
            <p>Empathy should always be valued highly as it is one of the indicators of how nice it is to be around you.
                While learning it's important to be empathetic as we all have different speed, level of understanding,
                so this is the moment to really practice that. While programming just be open minded and even if your
                view is completely opposite to the other party hear them out. Imagine that whatever they are saying is
                something you dont know and its gonna make you a bit smarter. Odds are it will.</p>
            <p>Self awarness play a crucial role as not only how we display ourselves in the world but also how we
                affect ourselves by ourselves. You have to be aware of what you are doing, what you are saying
                especially in the moments of stress or discomfort as these moment might make a greater imprint in our
                minds. Self aware all day every day.</p>
            <p><strong><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em></strong> How many of these
                ideas are widely acknowledged yet used/practiced so rarely.</p>
            <p><strong><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em></strong> Sitting down and
                trying to be as honest with yourself as you can because there is no point in lying.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                        learning in a web development bootcamp course?</em></strong> Because you have tapped into this
                knowledge of what really matters when it comes 'creating' IT field ready people. All the techy stuff we
                can teach, faster/slower but its possible to do that relatively easy. Now Core skills - for some they
                come naturally or it's just the environment where they grew up. For the rest of us we will have to learn
                them it's not like we don't have any - we do, each of us at different amounts and expertise but that's
                the best part about skill - you can pick them up.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                        have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></strong>
                No! It does not. I spent this time reading on these topics as I wasn't as familiar with them and I see
                the significance of them. I acknowledge that this will probably be one of my main focus areas.</p>

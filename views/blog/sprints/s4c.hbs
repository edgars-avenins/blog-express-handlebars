            <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <p><em><strong>1. Reasearch Neuroplasticity</strong></em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is the first and most important step as it may
                        be the one that starts to move your thought train. The principles of this topic should be enough
                        to raise interest in individuals to try understand more about themselves. And ultimately
                        improve.</li>
                    <li>1st step after finishing this task I'll do a refresher on previous sprints and spend a minute
                        reflecting on them. Repeat that in future. Keep the challenge alive on a daily basis. When I'm
                        learning I should try to incorporate my knowledge from other/similar topics.</li>
                    <li>Find a new hobby or strengthen your current one. Try a different approach at problem solving.
                        Consciously decide that you will learn a new [insert skill or whatever here] and work towards
                        it. Everyday even if for 5 minutes.</li>

                            examples on how to learn anything</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><em><strong>2. Research Growth Mindset</strong></em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Growth mindset is a setting of your mind that thinks in terms of improvement and the vast
                        potential of available improvement around us, for us, for people around us. This mindset is what
                        is going to make neuroplasticity work and prove to us individually that our potential is way
                        greater than we ever imagined.</li>
                    <li>Forgotten thoughts resurfaced and made even more sense now. Looking back I'm already practicing
                        it and succeeding as well.</li>
                    <li>I'll tell that little voice that tries to bring me down to shut up. And practice mindfulness
                        with some positive reinforcement. You CAN do this. You KNOW how to solve this.</li>
                    <li>A book which translates into: <em>Nothing is not impossible</em></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><em><strong>3. Mix it in with learning plan and strategies</strong></em>
                <ul>
                    <li>These understanding may influence my learning if I act on this information. They definitely are
                        shaping my understanding of topic and significance of it. It's all important and revolutionary
                        even but only if I do these things. So my plan is to try and involve them.</li>

            <h1>HTML & CSS The Differences</h1>
            <p><em><strong>HTML</strong></em> is responsible for the content you see on the page. If we take away CSS
                then what we see is just lines of text piled one upon the other.</p>
            <p><em><strong>CSS</strong></em> is responsible for how the content looks like, how is it layed out and
                overall it's limited to design.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Analogy</strong></em> example would be that when building a house you first need foundations
                and then the general frame(HTML) of the house and only then you add the exterior design(CSS)</p>
            <hr>
            <p><em><strong>Control flow</strong></em> is the order in which the computer executes statements in a
                script. It's quite straight forward(teoretically) but in real world there are many things that might
                make this flow less linear and more chaotic(at first glance).</p>
            <p><em><strong>Loops</strong></em> are one part of control flow that might make it go in different
                directions when combined with conditional statements. If you find yourself writing the same code with
                minor changes several times the odds are that you aren't following DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) rules and
                loops are a good candidate for following those.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><em><strong>DOM</strong></em> is a way for us to interact with HTML & XML documents. DOM translate the
                end product to these lines written in code editor and vice versa.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><em><strong>Data: Objects Vs Arrays.</strong></em> Arrays are like linear lists that have some
                information at given position. Objects on the other hand are ..objects and they have properties same as
                in real world and these properties can be nested and end up quite specific. When accessing this data in
                arrays we are looking at a specific position on this array. With objects we are calling for this object
                and then the property we need.</p>
            <p>Arrays: console.log(array[0]) .....vs..... Objects: console.log(object.property)</p>
            <hr>
            <p><em><strong>Functions</strong></em> help us to make our code reusable i.e. when you find yourself writing
                that temperature conversion formula for the 10th time you could instead write it once, call it a
                function and then just call it whenever you need it. It helps to keep your code clear and it's easier
                for other when they are viewing your code to understand what is going on there as well.</p>
